# Deteksi-Wajah
The project is divided into two parts :
1. Understanding streamlit and how it works, why opt for using streamlit.
2. Using Haar cascades to detect faces in a video stream.

For face detection app there are many ways to implement this and for various situations also. You could build a model from scratch and train of lots of images that have faces, or you could use a pretrained model and work on images. We will be using Haar cascade classifier that are based on machine learning approach.
